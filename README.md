# NeuralNetworks

# Here I am to try to help people with Machine Learning (ML) questions!

Welcome to my repository and thank you for see this content!

ML is a powerful and amazing technique to build a lot of programs who will implement learning and get some datasets to predict a bunch of situation
like Weather Forecast, probabilities about a patient develop a desease in certain period of him life, learn words, spell them and more.

Here I'll try to explain for student and newcommers in this context the main concepts and how to apply it in program language using Python.

So, if you are looking for fun with algorithms, you are in the right place!

Enjoy your time!
